# Vortex DB

## What is this project?

Vortex DB is a robust and efficient database solution designed to handle complex data operations with ease. Leveraging advanced Rust libraries, it provides high performance and reliability for managing large-scale data systems.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Utilizes RocksDB for fast key-value storage.
- **Data Serialization**: Supports serialization using `bincode` and `serde`.
- **Concurrency**: Employs `parking_lot` and `async-channel` to handle concurrent operations smoothly.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow` and `internment`.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Fully asynchronous architecture supported by `async-trait` and `async-channel`.
- **Chronological Data Management**: Integrates `chrono` for effective date and time management.
- **Flexible Data Structures**: Uses `ordered-float` and `uuid` for flexible data representation.
